## Origins of Life

- theory of Urey and Miller
- in the early days, temperature of earth was very high
- weather was uncertain, and due to the temp and lightning, something organic came into existence

<br>

- Amino acid are building blocks of protein and protein creates different beings

- mainly divided into terrestial and aquatic


## terrestial ecosystems

- further divided based on the temperature 
  - <code style="background-color: #43b02a40; padding:3px 2px; border-radius: 5px">Tropic Zones</code>
  - <code style="background-color: #43b02a40; padding:3px 2px; border-radius: 5px">Temperate Zones</code>
      

### forest ecosystem

- high density of flora and fauna
  
#### tropical evergreen forest 

- mean rainfall of 80 for every 400 inch
- high diversity of animals (especially insects)
  
#### tropical deciduous forest

- equall dry and rainy (30 to 60 inch)
- shed leaves when dry
   
#### temperate evergreen forest

- lower temperature than tropical, high rainfall

#### temperate deciduous forest

#### taiga (boreal) forest

- near arctic
- evergreen conifers
- houses are made of wood for conifers
  - wood - for insulating cold
  - conifers - for surviving snow

### desert ecosystem

- annual rainfall less than 25 inch

### grassland ecosystem

- <code style="background-color: #43b02a40; padding:3px 2px; border-radius: 5px">savanna</code>: tropical grassland
- <code style="background-color: #43b02a40; padding:3px 2px; border-radius: 5px">prairies</code>: temperate grassland

### montane or mountain ecosystem

### tundra or alpine ecosystem

- polar regions
- no trees
- only lichens(symbiotic relation)

### ice ecosystem

- no lichens

## importance of mangronves

- need both salt and fresh water
- can extract fresh water from salt water
  - need for fresh is a problem nowadays
- hold the coast line
- mangroves are in danger because of the port industry
- very high capacity(4x more than terrestial) of absorbing carbod dioxide
